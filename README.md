# Is there space in the parking lot? :car:
## Work in progress :wrench:
This project aims to give the correct amount of occupied and free parking spaces in the parking lot in real time. 
The current version uses the [YOLOv3 model](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) trained on the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
- [X] testing pretrained model on pictures
--> only works reliably on pictures taken during the day
- [Â ] data collection
- [ ] training + testing new model 
- [ ] creating stream of continuous input and evaluation (~1 picture per minute) 
- [ ] build Telegram bot or web application to access parking lot space information
